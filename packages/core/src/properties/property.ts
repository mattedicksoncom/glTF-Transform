/**
 * # Property
 *
 * *Properties represent distinct resources in a glTF asset, referenced by other properties.*
 *
 * For example, each material and texture is a property, with material properties holding
 * references to the textures. All properties are created with factory methods on the
 * {@link Document} in which they should be constructed. Properties are destroyed by calling
 * {@link dispose}().
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const texture = doc.createTexture('myTexture');
 * doc.listTextures(); // → [texture x 1]
 *
 * // Attach a texture to a material.
 * material.setBaseColorTexture(texture);
 * material.getBaseColortexture(); // → texture
 *
 * // Detaching a texture removes any references to it, except from the doc.
 * texture.detach();
 * material.getBaseColorTexture(); // → null
 * doc.listTextures(); // → [texture x 1]
 *
 * // Disposing a texture removes all references to it, and its own references.
 * texture.dispose();
 * doc.listTextures(); // → []
 * ```
 *
